This was a project I created for my Algorithmic Game Theory class.

The idea behind it was to create a Tic Tac Toe computer that plays with optimal strategy, or in other words, an unbeatable Tic Tac Toe bot. The user may be able to draw against the computer, but the user should never be able to win.

The computer employs Minimax, a decision rule-based system that makes choices by traversing through every node of the Tic Tac Toe game tree, in order to makes its every decision. By doing so, the computer should exhaust every possible game that could be played when making its decision.

The GUI displays some of the computer's "thinking process" in deciding on a square. "-1" signifies a square that should result in a loss, "0" signifies a square that should result in a tie, and "1" signifies a square that should result in a win.
